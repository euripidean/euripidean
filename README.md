# Ey up!
## Hi, I'm Jane!

I'm a graduate of the **Dev Degree** program at **Shopify** and am currently working for them as a full-time Software Engineer on the Ads Engine team. 

Before getting into development, I had a 15 year career in the Arts working for theatres and film festivals in various Ticketing leadership roles. Changing careers and starting Dev Degree at the age of 38 was a real challenge, but one that I relished!
